# Market Research Report: Proposed Edutech Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

### Purpose:

This research was conducted to assess the current Educational Technology (Edutech) market and identify the need for an integrated learning platform that can bridge the gap between educators and learners, support both synchronous and asynchronous learning modes, and ensure quality assurance through teacher verification.

### Key Findings:

• Many existing platforms (Udemy, Coursera, Skillshare) primarily support only asynchronous, pre-recorded content, limiting real-time interaction between teachers and students.

• Independent educators struggle with fragmented content distribution across multiple platforms (YouTube, TikTok, WhatsApp, Telegram), making it difficult for students to discover and compare teaching options.

• There is a significant gap in teacher credibility verification, with most platforms lacking systematic certification checks, leading to concerns about unqualified instructors.

• Students lack centralized mechanisms for complaints, refunds, and quality reporting, creating trust issues in the online learning ecosystem.

• The demand for flexible learning formats (live, recorded, hybrid) is growing, but current solutions do not adequately support teachers' freedom to design their preferred delivery methods.

### Recommendations:

Develop a unified Edutech platform with integrated teacher verification, support for multiple learning formats (live, recorded, hybrid), built-in review and reporting mechanisms, and a commission-based revenue model that enables sustainable scalability.
